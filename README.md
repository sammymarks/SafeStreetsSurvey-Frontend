# Welcome to Safe Streets Survey

## Overview
**Safe Streets Survey** is a Mobile-friendly browser application to help local organizations crowdsource community feedback on local infrastructure issues.

**In partnership with the [Chicago 40th Ward](https://40thward.org/)**, the initial version of Safe Streets Survey will replace the current community tool to identify gaps in local pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure.

**The goal** is to and enable simple and detailed user feedback and streamline Ward triage of issues for bigger-picture resolution.

**Down the road**, we are looking to expand this into an open source initiative for any organization to create a location-based project to survey local infrastructure, including other governmental groups, park and community advisory boards, etc.

***Note** - This repo is for the front-end React application. The **repo for the backend** server and seed file can be found [here](https://github.com/sammymarks/SafeStreetsSurvey-Backend). **The deployed site** can be found [here](https://safe-streets-survey.netlify.app/).*
